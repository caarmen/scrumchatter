Scrum Chatter Privacy Policy
============================

Scrum Chatter does not have the `INTERNET` permission, so it cannot send any data over the internet.

Scrum Chatter stores all data you explicitly enter while using the app into a local database *not* accessible by other applications.  This includes:
* team names
* member names
* meeting dates
* speaking times of team members at meetings

Scrum Chatter gives you the possibility to share certain information.  This requires your active manual interaction with the app.
Scrum Chatter cannot transmit this information anywhere silently or without your knowledge.
When you explicitly choose to share this information, you select another app which will transmit the data.
Scrum Chatter provides the information to share to the app you choose, and the app you choose transmits the data to whoever you choose.

Data you can explicitly choose to share, using an external app:
* From a meeting screen, the "Share" icon allows you to share speaking times for team members at one specific meeting.
* From a stats screen, the "Share" icon allows you to share the image of the selected chart.  This depends on the screen.  This can be:
  - column chart: speaking times for members during one meeting
  - line chart: meeting durations over a time period
  - pie charts: average and total speaking time for team members
* From the main screen, the "Share" icon allows you to share all team, member and meeting data in Excel or database format.
